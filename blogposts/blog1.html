      <h2>Studying japanese in Japan - Part 1: Why?</h2>
      <p>It is a bit surprising, even to myself, that the first post on a website that I first imagined to be about tech
        related issues turned out to be about Japan. It is now… hold on… 16 years since I first set my foot in the land
        of the rising sun with the only plan for the future being to learn the Japanese language. As I look back on
        those times it is not without a significant amount of nostalgia. It is true that I was in fact very home sick at
        the end of my stay. That could however have been a result of my accumulated experience or lack thereof at the
        young age of 21. I have many times wished that I would have gone to japan after at least having worked a few
        years in Sweden. God knows these past 16 years since I returned have put a lot of things into perspective for
        me. Regardless, I don’t regret that I went when I did. Not for one second have I regretted it. The timing could have been
        better is all I’m saying. </p>
      <p>You see, even if Japan is not your thing, going to another country and learning their language and experiencing
        their culture is something I strongly recommend everyone to do. Especially if you are kind of stuck in the
        hamster wheel, looking for some change of pace. It will give you a completely different perspective on your life
        and the world we live in. And this doesn’t stop the day you go back home. This experience will shape the rest of
        your life, most likely for the better. Will studying abroad make you a better person? No, but it will probably
        help you grow by challenging you. Sure, if you’re french and go to Italy to study, it’s probably not gonna be
        especially challenging. You’ll probably master the language in two or three months and despite what you might
        think now, your cultures are in fact very similar. </p>
      <p>Yet challenge is not everything. As a foreign language student you are completely free in a way that not even
        college students in your home country are. Your only obligation in life is literally showing up for a few hours
        to attend class. In Japanese language schools class is only three hours per day. More on that later, but it
        gives you tonnes of time to just explore. Maybe you’ll take a part time job (where you’re guaranteed to meet
        lots of new people). Maybe join a club. Or maybe you’ll do a home stay, getting to know a family native to that
        country's culture, probably making friends for life. Or perhaps you’ll spend your free time traveling. The
        possibilities are endless. It could be the restart of your life you’ve been looking for these past years. Of
        course the language studies don’t end when class ends and languages that are very different from old world
        languages, like African or Asian ones, will be very challenging to learn. So you’ll probably not be able to goof
        off completely. But that brings us to the other fantastic thing about studying languages abroad: your
        classmates. </p>

      <p>One of the most memorable experiences were growing and learning together with a bunch of other people who, like
        me, were more or less beginners in Japanese. Most of them couldn’t speak english either. So paying attention in
        class was the only way we could bridge the language gap and start communicating. At first our conversations were
        limited to subjects like “what do you eat in your country?” and “do you like Japan?”. But in just a few weeks
        conversations were getting smother. And even if we couldn’t quite understand each other in the beginning, it
        didn’t stop us from having a lot of fun together. Gathering to study at the neighboring university (which
        actually owned our language school) while having some coffee or melon bread and just hanging out are some of my
        fondest memories of Japan. </p>
      <p>So now that we have established why you should study a language abroad, the question remains: why japan? Well,
        if you can read Swedish, you can just read the guide that turned me into a japanophile. Unfortunately the
        author, Tor, has taken down the site, but it can still be visited via the <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110113061730/http://www.freezoon.net/jap/">way back machine</a>. For a
        newer perspective, there is <a href="https://vilseijapan.se/om-vilse-japan/">vilse is japan</a>. But Tor Dahlsjö
        will forever have a special place in my heart. If by some weird chance you are reading this, thank you so much.
        You changed my life to a degree that very few other people can claim. </p>

      <p>Okay, but you are still here, so maybe you can’t read Swedish or perhaps you are still interested in what I
        have to say on the subject. Well, Japan is a very special country. A country of contrasts. A modern first world
        country which has retained its old cultural roots, in large part unspoiled by americanized homogenized western
        culture and eastern cultural revolutions. Imagine if Scandinavia was never converted to christianity and instead
        would have grown into a modern society while keeping its old pagan roots. Holidays, deities, shrines, letters
        and customs preserved, but adapted to a modern world. This is in many ways still how Japan is, even though
        globalization is eating deeper and deeper into its society, for better and worse. If old buddhist and pagan
        culture is not your thing, Japan still has a lot to offer.</p>
      <p> Some of the other amazing things Japan has to offer are a working railway system (truly a sight to see for a
        european), 24 hour convenience stores that are not out to rob you blind, a government that does not believe it
        knows how to live your life better than you, privacy and integrity, people who take pride in their work and
        actually care about doing a good job, high fashion and trendsetting music and art. Although I admit that South
        Korea is the big name in Asia for music, film and TV nowadays, for many decades large parts of Asia were
        watching Japanese dramas and listening to Jpop. Not to mention the comics and video games that have influenced
        generations of people around the world. Ask an Italian about Captain Tsubasa or an American about Dragonball Z
        and you’ll see what I mean. But the most striking and fun part about Japan is that it is a country where things
        happen. No matter where your interests lie, you can be sure that there are almost unlimited numbers of people
        who share them and ample opportunities to explore them in Japan. There are festivals, clubs, teams, meetups,
        seminars and so much more just waiting for you. And the people there are genuinely excited to meet people who
        share their interests, foreigners or not. </p>
      For some perspective, where I have lived in Sweden up until now the big events are mostly limited to a few days of
      street markets where you get the privilege of buying the same five overpriced food items a few times a year. No
      religious or traditional festivals. No big school festivals or events for the kids. No parades. Live music is
      limited to large arena spectacles with ticket prices that will have medical doctors and lawyers eating ramen for
      months afterwards. Okay, I’m exaggerating, but just look at what is happening in my wife’s home town a normal
      year:
      <ul>
        <li>Yamakasa: an event where men man up and undress to race around town in the early, early hours of the day
          carrying towering floats that have been meticulously decorated.</li>
        <li>Nakasu Festival: This time it’s women carrying portable shrines around town. Sadly not while in a state of
          undress.</li>
        <li>Tamaseseri: Another event where manly men undress, this time to play with balls. Not as homo erotic as it
          sounds. </li>
        <li>Toka Ebisu: A big fishing festival where the highlight is a rare appearance of the town’s geisha. </li>
        <li>Setsubun: A festival and event celebrated all over japan which among other things involve throwing beans.
        </li>
        <li>Obon: A festival in the honor of our ancestors who have passed away. Complete with traditional music and
          dance.</li>
        <li>Dontaku: A festival with the main event is a parade where groups of people just… parade. I don’t know how to
          explain it properly. People come up with themes, songs, dances, clothes etc and parade around town.</li>
        <li>Asian Party: A long event celebrating asian cultures with dance, music and food.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>These are only some of the big official events. Add to this a bunch of smaller art and music events throughout
        the year. All larger shrines and temples have many of their own festivals. The summers are filled with firework
        festivals both in the cities and in the countryside. Schools have sports events and culture festivals that
        parents and siblings take time out of their busy days to visit. How many times can I write the word festival
        before I start questioning what it even means? And all of these events of course come with delicious food and
        drink – reasonably priced! No deep fried bread with sour cream and unmelted, pre-shredded cheese for $15.</p>
      <p>You are more of an outdoors person? Japan has excellent surfing, diving, fishing and hiking and the country is
        still mostly free of ticks. Oh and their ski resorts are world class. Like music? There is live music of all
        kinds to be experienced every week in all reasonably sized cities. Jazz – check, metal – check, disgustingly
        plebian pop music – check, weird underground pop music – double check. You a foodie? Japanese food has a
        reputation of being some of the best in the world. That includes their foreign food. Few coutries have as many
        world class french restaurants outside of France itself. Their lager beer and whisky are world class, their wine
        surprisingly good and there are millions of attractive, intelligent and funny people in whom’s company you can
        enjoy these beverages. And everything is once again reasonably priced. Some people in Japan, especially single
        people, eat out every day for both lunch and dinner. Try that in Scandinavia and you’ll soon wonder why there
        isn’t any money left in the bank when its time to pay rent.</p>
      <p> If all of the above sounds completely unappealing, Japan is at least worth visiting just to see what a society
        where people don’t act like anti-social thugs is like. Japan is obscenely free of graffiti, smashed store
        windows, vandalized bus stops, urine-stinking subways, trash in the streets and all other things we take for
        granted here in the west. </p>
      <p> But how would one study Japanese in Japan? More on that in my next post.</p>
