      <h2>Tech: Gopherspace</h2>
      <p>
        Some of you may have heard that there is actually a difference between the Internet
        and the World Wide Web. But what would this difference be? The terms seem to be interchangeable
        in how people use them. The difference becomes very clear when you compare the World Wide Web
        to the topic of this post: Gopher.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you visit a website on the web, you have surely noticed that the address starts with
        the text "https://". Yeah of course, you may think, websites are fetched using the http
        protocol and web apis are also based on this. Http is how the Internet works, right?
        Yes, it is how the <i>World Wide Web</i> works, but there are other ways of
        sharing data over the Internet. The Internet refers to the big network of interconnected
        computers covering our world. Http and the World Wide Web is just one way for these
        computers to communicate with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may seem obvious for those of you who are programmers. You have
        probably developed applications that connect to a TCP socket on a server and start sending
        raw data. This works over local networks as well as over the Internet. No http needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        So http and the World Wide Web is just a way for computers on the Internet to send information
        to each other. But there was an Internet before the World Wide Web. Files could be shared via FTP
        long before websites were a thing. And there were of course the famous Bulletin Board Systems
        where users could connect to a server to share files and post messages. Both FTP and BBS are
        ancient technologies, hardly used anymore on the modern Internet. But they are at least
        still quite well known in the tech sphere. But have you ever heard of the Gopher protocol?
        An internet technology that does not serve webpages in the form of html, but pure text
        files (though I guess html could technically be hosted on a gopher server). Imagine something
        so primitive. No ads up in your face, no videos starting up in your background
        tabs. Just text. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It may sound crazy, but that is kind of appealing to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, Gopher is structured a lot differently from the web (which isn't really structured at all).
        Files are linked to in a hierarchy, kind of like in a file system. But it was not really the technical 
        aspects of Gopher that made me curious about it.

        Gopher is not dead. According to Wikipedia, the number of Gopher servers has actually increased since 2015.
        But it's only used by very few people. This of course intrigues the hipster in me.
        I must admit, I have only started exploring Gopherspace very recently, but I'm exited
        about what I've found. Well, there's mostly articles and blogs (called phlogs) there
        to be honest. But that's the charm!
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you have heard of the Dead Internet Theory? If not, here is (ironically enough) a
        quick AI summary of it:
      </p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p class="w3-large w3-serif">
          <i>"The Dead Internet Theory is a fringe conspiracy theory suggesting that much of the content on the internet
            today is generated by bots or artificial intelligence, rather than by real human users. Here's a short
            summary:
            <br><br>
            Core Idea: The theory claims that sometime around the mid-2010s, the internet "died" in the sense that
            genuine human activity was largely replaced by automated content.
            <br><br>
            Bot Dominance: It argues that bots now produce a significant portion of online content—articles, social
            media posts, comments, videos—creating the illusion of vibrant human interaction.
            <br><br>
            Manipulation: Proponents believe this shift is orchestrated by governments, corporations, or other powerful
            entities to control public opinion, promote consumerism, or suppress dissent.
            <br><br>
            Evidence Cited: Supporters often point to repetitive or low-quality content, suspicious engagement metrics,
            and the rise of AI-generated media as signs of a "dead" internet.
            <br><br>
            While intriguing, the theory is widely considered speculative and lacks concrete evidence. It reflects
            broader concerns about authenticity, automation, and manipulation in the digital age."</i>
        </p>

      <p>
        While Copilot tries to play this off as a conspiracy theory, I believe there is a lot of 
        truth to it. Surely you have seen the AI-slop being posted to Facebook nowadays,
        with people who must be lobotomized commenting on them like the images were real. Or more likely,
        the commenters are bots. Take a look at this Rolling Stone 
        <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/facebook-ai-generated-slop-1235095088/">article</a>
        for examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web is no doubt full of fake people desperate for your clicks and attention.
        While an AI generated video of Albert Einstein facing off with 
        Stephen Hawing in MMA is a funny distraction, when everything is a distraction
        and nothing has substance it all gets very tiring. Or maybe I'm just old.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you happen to be a senile old millennial like I am, 
        perhaps the thought of the Internet as it was in its infancy is more appealing?
        Back then the internet consisted of text and images made by real people for real people. 
        That internet was slow. You could find a forum with a handful of members discussing your particular
        interests and you could come back a day later without having to catch up with 2000
        new posts. God, I sound like an old hippie. 
        But for people like us, Gopherspace holds that kind of mysterious allure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I read a phlog by an American who's been living in Japan for 30 years
        exitedly describing how he's getting his old Palm Pilot from '02 up and running,
        it feels real. I know this person really exists and that what he is writing is 
        most likely what he really thinks. It's not a performance for status or clicks. 
        They are not trying to sell anything.
        It's just small window into a person's thoughts, leaving you with the feeling 
        that there is an entire life and story behind it. Kind of what I want this 
        website to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, if you want to take a look for yourself, get a browser that supports 
        Gopher. Since I'm a Mac user, I use Lagrange.
        If you're on Linux, try installing Gopher and running it from your terminal 
        (sudo apt install gopher on Debian-likes).
        You're mostly just going to be viewing text anyway, so why bother with a fancy browser?
        Plus, using the terminal makes you look like a super cool hacker.
        If you're on Windows, stop using Windows. Don't you know this is the year of 
        the Linux desktop? No? Well, we're gonna keep saying it anyway until it becomes reality.
