                <p>I am a soon to be middle-aged man from Sweden with a wide variety of interests. Hiking, hunting,
                    programming, photography, studying whatever takes my interest (mostly technical stuff). <br>
                    <br>
                    At the age of 19 I moved to Japan and stayed there for two years studying Japanese at a language
                    school
                    in Kyoto. I can still speak and (barely) read Japanese and the country has always had a special
                    place in
                    my heart. Thus I will also write about Japan from time to time.<br>
                    <br>
                    I work for a Japanese robot manufacturer as a software engineer and also do some freelance
                    programming
                    and consulting. While originally trained as a mechanical engineer I have
                    always
                    loved computers and digital technology. Even though I only had a little experience in Python at the
                    time, my first job involved developing software and I never went back after that. I have also
                    worked,
                    and still do from time to time, with automation and system integration.
